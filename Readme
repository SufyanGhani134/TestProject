The movie App has a user-friendly interface that displays movie information in the form of cards. Each card shows the movie's title and the year it was released, along with a small icon in the bottom right corner. By clicking on the icon, users can view additional details about the movie, such as the plot summary, cast members, and ratings.

To search for a specific movie, users can use the input field located in the top right corner of the screen. If the movie is available in the database, the App will display a card with all the relevant details. However, if the movie is not available in the database, the App will revert to displaying the default cards with information about other movies.
